Content & Structure
===================

The other sections of this guide deal, largely, with the matter of using the Django Church CMS. It's basically the user guide to all the knobs and levers behind the curtain that tell the site what to show and where. But, if the CMS is the puppeteer's frame and strings, the puppet is the content itself.

The following sections have been written with the aim of giving you some help and direction in thinking about the structure of your site and how you should approach your content. There are no *absolutely right* ways to go about this process. There are, however, some *reliably wrong* way to approach it, which we'll help you side-step.
