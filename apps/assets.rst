Assets
======


If you want to add an image to a page, or link to a PDF - a newsletter for example - from a page, you first need to upload it to the CMS. Assets is where you do that.

Asset models
------------

Assets break down into two groups, files and images. Images are exactly as you'd expect - typically photos of one form or another with file-types such as JPG, GIF and PNG. Files are literally everything else; DOC, PDF, PPT, XLS, TXT etc. The models here are paired, in that files and images each have a counterpart category model where you can manage the categories for each. These two pairs are functionally identical as far as their management is concerned, so we'll use files as the example case here…

File categories
---------------

1. Click Home > Assets > File categories
2. Here are listed all the categories that can be applied to files.
3. To edit an existing category, click the category name.
4. To add a new category, click "Add file category".
5. The only field available for editing is the category title its self.

Files
-----

1. Click Home > Assets > Files
2. Here are listed all the files currently available in the system.
3. Each file presents the following bits of meta, from left to right…
    1. File title (click here to view)
    2. Category (as defined by the File categories model above)
    3. The URL of the asset (clicking lets you preview the file)
4. To edit an existing file, click the file name.
5. To add a single new file, click "Add single file".
6. To add multiple new files simultaneously, click "Add multiple files".
